HAHAHAHAHA This is just most easy OSINT you can ever come accross to.
So you call yourselves “hackers,” huh? Funny, because the only thing you’ve hacked so far is your own ego. You’re out here flexing your terminal screenshots like you’re in Mr. Robot, but can’t even figure out that the answer isn’t hiding in your payloads, it’s hiding in plain sight. You’ve opened 20 useless tools, run 50 noisy scans, and yet somehow missed the most basic thing — reading the files that are literally handed to you. Maybe grep can’t save you, maybe nmap won’t hold your hand this time, because this challenge doesn’t need your “leet” dictionary attacks. It just needs you to use the one tool you’ve ignored since kindergarten: your eyes. I mean, if mock.txt was a snake, it would have already bitten you and still you’d cry for Burp Suite. Keep pretending you’re 1337 warriors, but until you actually read what’s right in front of you, you’re just script-kiddies clicking blindly in the dark. Pro tip: real hackers don’t skip the README.

# IPC CTF – OSINT Challenge

Welcome, “hackers.”  
If you’re reading this, congratulations — you’ve managed to find the README. That alone is probably the most impressive thing some of you will do all day.  

This challenge isn’t about how fast you can run nmap or how many tabs of Burp Suite you can open before your laptop cries. It’s about paying attention. Something most of you are painfully bad at.  

You’ll notice a little file named **`mock.txt`**. Go ahead, open it. Bask in the glory of your own disappointment. Maybe you’ll even find what looks like a flag. Maybe it’ll make you feel special for five minutes before reality smacks you again.  

But here’s a tip, champ: real hackers don’t stop at the first shiny thing they see. The ones who know how to win… they read *everything*.  

So, are you a legend? Or just another script-kiddie who falls for the bait?  

Good luck. You’ll need it.
